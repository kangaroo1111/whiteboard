# whiteboard
whiteboard tool as a replacement for jamboard

Currently, there is only a .vue file which I have run using online compilers

TODO: 
1) fix error: can't write on most recently created board
2) implement http server so it works like google docs/sheets/jamboard
3) add compatibility with google drive
4) home page with list of projects, click on project to go to its whiteboards
5) scroll up and down to switch whiteboards
6) add 'save' functionality that saves whiteboard project to google drive
7) add undo/redo functions
8) add different marker colors
